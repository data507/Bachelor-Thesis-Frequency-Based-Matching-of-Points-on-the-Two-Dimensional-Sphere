# Bachelor-Thesis-Frequency-Based-Matching-of-Points-on-the-Two-Dimensional-Sphere
This is a collection of algorithms I created for my Bachelor's thesis at University Osnabr√ºck. Most importantly it includes a fast algorithm for finding a rotation that matches two sets of points on the sphere.

## Dependencies
Julia Packages: Rotations, SphericalHarmonics, WignerD, NFFT, LinearAlgebra, StaticArrays, StatsBase
